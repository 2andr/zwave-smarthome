It  is SDK 4.5, has Explorer Frame Support and increased network stability.<\/p>\r\n<p>This radiator thermostat is mounted on wall heating valves and controls them by a motor. The device accepts a setpoint that is either set manually using buttons on the device or wirelessly using Z-Wave. Afterwards, the device will regulate the warm water supply to the wall radiator and compare the detected temperature to ensure, that the temperature in the room is kept at the desired level. A small LCD panel on the device displays the setpoint temperature on request.<\/p>\r\n<p>The device has an internal scheduler, that allows to define up to 9 setpoint for up to 7 week days. Once programmed, these setpoints will be activated without any further manual or wireless interaction. Beside setting a desired temperature the device will support special heating schemes, such as energy saving and frost protection and intelligent functions such as detection of open windows or a valve training function to ensure that valves are still operational after longer periods. &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The livinng connect can be mounted to valves with standard M30x1.5 connector or RA2000 (Danfoss snap in).&nbsp;<\/p>",

It can wirelessly  \treport immediate wattage and kWh usage  to central control point gateways and can be easily installed.  \t Installed in an electricity box, the energy meter will monitor the total  consumption of electricity used by an entire building. \tAnd its  intelligent clamps will report that energy use back to your control  point, in watts or  \tkilowatt-hours, and in real time. So you can see  how much electricity you really use and when you use it.<\/p>\r\n<p>The main body is anchored using a back mount. The device is powered from a normal AC power supply. The device has <b> two clamps<\/b> and reports W and kWH (up to 60 Ampere).<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

One of the parts is mounted on the moving part of the window or of the door. The other part is placed on the frame. The installation can be done with screws or double-sided tape. The device is battery-operated and therefore in sleeping mode unless an action is detected. After a programmable sleeping time the device wakes up and sends a status information. After this the unit goes back to sleeping modus. Batteries can be changed without unscrewing the device from the door or frame. The unit will give a visual warning on the device and sends a warning to the Z-Wave controller, when batteries need to be replaced. The units send information to a controller or any other associated Z-Wave device. Up to 5 devices can be controlled from this device.  Two terminals allows to connection of an external dry contact in parallel to the magnetic contact. A tamper switch protects the device from removal or manipulation if used in security applications. The powerful CR123 Lithium battery lasts 3...5 years n normal operation conditions. The device supports normal Z-Wave inclusion, auto inclusion and network wide inclusion for convenient handling. Scope of delivers includes the device itself, the bracket for the magnet and the magnet itself, the battery, adhesive tape and an instruction manual.<\/p>",

Devices can be turned on and off but dimmers and motor controls can also be turned into a desired dimming level to motor position by keeping a button pushed and releasing it. Additionally the device can act as a primary controller of a Z-Wave network using three dedicated network control buttons located behind a sliding cover. 10 pair of buttons &ndash; illuminated by blue light when operated &ndash; allow to control up to 7 control groups (association groups) and 3 scenes. The scenes learn the desired status of selected actuators and can turn them back into this status just hitting a button. The devices in the 7 control groups a re always switched simultaneously. The remote control can operate as a secondary control beside an IP-Gateway however it is not possible from this device to activate scenes defined in the IP-Gateway. All scenes and control groups are stored within the remote control and they are also conveniently programmed using the buttons of the remote rather than using wireless commands from an IP-Gateway.<\/p>",

    "ZProductDescription": "<p>The Z-Wave compatible smoke detector from manufacturer Popp detects reliably emerging fires in your house and safes life and estate of your family. Recoginzing fires primary works free of radioactivity with the help of a photoelectric sensor, which reacts on smoke particle concentrations between 1.8 % and 3.1 %. Additionally, the smoke detector contains a temperature sensor, which is used parallelly for detecting fires, avoiding false alarm and at the same time measuring the temperature in the room. According to the guideline DIN EN14604, the smoke detector warns via a light signal and a siren. This siren has a defined volume of 85db in a distance of 3 meters. The device comes along with a modern design. It is easy to install and easy for professional installers to open for cleaning. A lock prevents the installation of the device without battery. The automatic self-calibration and self-test increase the reliability of the device. After the installation a manual system test can be done by pushing the key button on the device. The smoke detector has a wireless connection to the Z-Wave network. The measured values of the temperature sensor and the current battery level can be read out by a Z-Wave controller. A regular status report of the sensor enables a comfortable centralized management of many devices. It generates different alarm signals that either are received and evaluated by a central Z-Wave controller or can control switching actions of other Z-Wave devices (e.g. turning on\/ off the light) directly:<\/p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Fire alarm (displayed locally by light and audio)<\/li>\r\n    <li>Battery level warning, when the battery power level drops below 20% (shown locally by light and short audio)<\/li>\r\n    <li>Tamper protection if the device is removed from the bracket<\/li>\r\n    <li>Fall above or below a temperature range (thresholds can be programmed wirelessly via Z-Wave)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

Additionally the device can act as a primary controller of a Z-Wave network using three dedicated network control buttons located behind a sliding cover. 10 pair of buttons &ndash; illuminated by blue light when operated &ndash; allow to control up to 7 control groups (association groups) and 3 scenes. The scenes learn the desired status of selected actuators and can turn them back into this status just hitting a button. The devices in the 7 control groups a re always switched simultaneously. The remote control can operate as a secondary control beside an IP-Gateway however it is not possible from this device to activate scenes defined in the IP-Gateway.

Single clicks operate one load, double click operates the other load. The device is delivered as complete set with flush mountable insert,  paddle and mounting frame compatible to the design of the switching series selected.  The paddle of the device is used to control the  device itself but can also be configured  to activate scenes in a central IP gateway or controller. The device is able to meter the  power consumed on the two loads if the attached load (in W) is configured correctly using a  configuration parameter. The status of the switch is indicated on a dual color LED for test  purposes and every status change is - if configured - reported to a central IP gateway or  controller. The function of the local paddle can be configured as detached from the local  operation. In this local control, different devices are controlled by Z-Wave while the  local actuator is controlled by other devices using Z-Wave.  This device is designed for a 3 wire system and needs a neutral wire in the wall box.<\/p>",
