        "info": "The Motion Detector is designed with two detecting sensors, Passive Infra-Red (PIR) sensor and light sensor, to detect movement within a protected area, operating at 868.42 , 908.42, and 921.42 MHz. \r\rThe detector can be used as a security device or home automation device.  When the detector is cooperated with security appliances, the detector is acting as a security device by detecting changes in infra-red radiation levels. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted to cause full alarm condition in order to frighten intruders away. Alternatively, when the detector is worked with Z-Wave Controller , the detector can be set to perform the role of home automation device by detecting both changes in infra-red radiation levels and percentage of lux levels.  Once night falls, the percentage of ambient illumination is lower than preset value. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted so as to turn connected lightings for better illumination.\r\rTwo mounting methods are provided for varying detection range.  The detector can be mounted on a wall for farther detecting distance but narrower coverage; while for ceiling mounting, shorter detecting distance can be made but desired coverage can be expected at user\u2019s disposal.",

The meter reading solution is based on the Z-Wave wireless standard, which is ideal for controlling automation products within the home.\r\rThe product consists of 3 parts: a Power Reader, a battery-powered wireless transmitter and a USB receiver. Electricity data is transferred to a chosen PC every 15 minutes, where it can then be visualized in the form of graphs, enabling customers to keep track of their electricity consumption (in kWh and in local currency), and monitor their CO2 emissions, etc. It is also possible to receive real-time measurements in order to investigate how much each individual appliance uses in active or standby mode.\r\rFurthermore, it is possible to enter a budget for how much you want to consume in EUR or kWh per year. The NorthQ eGadget on the screen continuously monitors and updates the electricity consumption data to indicate whether you are under or over budget. You are then able to compare your electricity consumption in the current year with that in previous years. It is also possible to compare the consumption in your current home with other types of homes, e.g. apartments, houses, villas, etc.",

        "info": "Wireless Z-WAVE Stick w\/auto installation & 2GB MemoryNorthQ, in collaboration with Dong Energy, has developed a small meter reader that can be easily installed on existing electronic or mechanical meters in order to visualize electricity consumption in private homes. The meter reading solution is based on the Z-Wave wireless standard, which is ideal for controlling automation products within the home.\r\rThe product consists of 3 parts: a meter reader, a battery-powered wireless transmitter and a USB receiver. Electricity usage data is transferred to a chosen PC every 15 minutes, where it can then be visualized in the form of graphs, enabling customers to keep track of their electricity consumption (in kWh and EUR), and monitor their CO2 emissions, etc.. It is also possible to receive real-time measurements in order to investigate how much each individual appliance uses in active or standby mode.\r\rFurthermore, it is possible to enter a power budget for how much you want to consume in EUR per year. A widget on the screen continuously monitors and updates electricity consumption data to indicate whether you are under or over budget. You are then able to compare your electricity consumption in the current year with that in previous years. It is also possible to compare the consumption in your current home with that in other types of dwelling, e.g. apartments, houses, villas, etc..\r\rThe meter reading solution can also be used in conjunction with the portal www.eualarm.tv or Google PowerMeter to get an overview of your total energy consumption and thus enable you to manage your home in a more energy efficient way. Apart from the obvious financial benefits this solution enables you to play a part in the global efforts to improve our environment through the reduction of CO2 emissions.\r\rWireless communications\rFrequency: 868.42(EU)\/908.42(US) MHz Z-Wave technology\rUpdate Rate: Approximately every 15Min\rRemote Distance: At least 50ft(15M-30M), indoors when properly installed in a typical environment.\r\rSupports\rEU\/US Z-Wave (5.02) RF version\rAEC (Advanced Energy Control framework from SigmaDesign)\rMechanical (Ferraris type) and electronic meters\rWireless firmware update\r\rSoftware compatibility\rXP\/VISTA\/WINDOWS7\r\rBattery lifetime\rMechanical meters: min.10 months w\/15 minutes interval\rEletronic meters: min.15 months w\/15 minutes interval\r\rSpecifications\rDetachable 5 meter sensor cable for increased tranmission range\rWeatherproof (both wireless transmitter and sensor cable)\rWallmount bracket included\rPairing\/unpairing\/reset button\/wake up button (realtime mode)\rLED indicator to indicate pairing, unpairing, reset and pulse counts\r512k eeprom (equivalent to 3 months meter data storage with 15 min. interval)\rReal Time Clock",

The Flood Detector is designed to sense the presence of water in basements, yachts and many others residential and commercial applications, providing early warning of developing floods. The Flood Detector is designed so that the transceiver is mounted on the wall and the flood sensor is placed in a location where water presence, such as a result of leakage or flooding, is probable. Upon flood detection, the Detector will beep and flash and report its status to the node ID. Once water is released, it will report to the node ID as well. \r\rThe Flood Detector is powered by 3 x AA 1.5V alkaline battery. When battery level drops below unacceptable level, the Detector flashes red LED once every 30 seconds and reports low battery status to the node ID. When this occurs, the batteries should be replaced as soon as possible.",

Only major changes in the moisture level is sent and the humidity sensor provides a very low power consumption. The measuring range is made \u200b\u200bfrom the central unit. At low battery in the sensor given message to the control panel, so users are notified and can replace the battery. sensor is under approval by Zensys, which must approve all products with Z-Wave integrated. We expect no change in design or software. Therefore, the sensor can be supplied already, in a non-certified version. Z-Wave RH can be supplied with your logo printed on the box. Z-Wave is a standard that brings together communication between electronic devices to a central control unit which provides the overall governance and control with function. The program of the Exchange may from moisture levels activate the air circulation, ventilation, heating or cooling as needed. Thus obtained an optimal system for control and regulation of comfort and energy consumption in buildings with intelligent installations. There is much to be saved by controlling heat and electricity consumption is intelligent. Z-Wave is recommended by the Trust, which advises in Denmark on the correct energy. Z-Wave has a normal range of around 30 meters, but with several units along the Z-Wave use the Entity built-in \"repeater\" function, whose characteristic contributes to high signal reliability.\r.",

You only need to be within 100 feet of any HomePro Z-Wave device to communicate with all other HomePro Z-Wave devices, so the more HomePro Z-Wave enabled devices you have in your home or office, the better the coverage and the more reliable the network becomes.\r\rNew software features (Version 1.26) allow changing the factory configuration of devices and reviewing the settings. In addition it allows association of a device with other specific devices and a review of those associations. The version of any HomePro ZTH100 can be verified by the following: Go to Setup Menu\/Reset Remote Control\/Factory Default\/press ALL LIGHTS OFF button.\r\rThe ZTH100 allows most devices into a group so they can be controlled by the remote.

If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted to cause full alarm condition in order to frighten intruders away. Alternatively, when the detector is worked with Z-Wave Controller , the detector can be set to perform the role of home automation device by detecting both changes in infra-red radiation levels and percentage of lux levels.  Once night falls, the percentage of ambient illumination is lower than preset value. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted so as to turn connected lightings for better illumination.\r\rTwo mounting methods are provided for varying detection range.

        "info": "CENTAURPLUS C17-ZW is a single channel central heating programmer with Z-Wave RF communication support. The CENTAURPLUS 17-ZW will act as a routing slave device in the Z-Wave networkHorstmann has introduced a new wireless version of its CentaurPlus ZW timeswitch that can save the householder up to 10% in energy costs* while being easy to install and programme.\r\rThe wireless CentaurPlus C17 ZW operates with the latest Horstmann HRT4-ZW wireless room thermostat and together, the two offer a highly efficient controls package ideally suited to combi boiler installations.\r\rIt is estimated that some 8 million homes* in the UK are operating central heating systems without a room thermostat as part of the controls package. Many of these are combi boiler installations where it was once considered sufficient for a time switch and TRV\u2019s on radiators to provide control. It is in fact an inefficient solution and leads to fluctuations in heating levels that can result in uncomfortable room temperatures and wasted energy consumption caused by excessive boiler cycling.\r\rBy replacing the existing timeswitch with a Horstmann CentaurPlus ZW and adding its HRT-4 ZW room thermostat, a unique energy saving control solution is created to achieve and maintain optimum control of room temperature settings. The pairing process using the Z-Wave technology in both units is both simple and reliable and the resulting enhanced control of temperature settings and the boiler firing regime is both energy saving and efficient.\r\rThe new CentaurPlus C17 ZW is the flagship model in a completely upgraded family of controls. As well as its wireless technology the unit now features a 24 hour BST\/GMT clock and a bright backlit display to assist with ease of reading and setting. Yet it retains the industry standard 6-pin back plate that makes upgrading a process that only takes minutes for a qualified installer. Alternatively, if the previous wall plate is non standard, it can be exchanged for a new plate (supplied) using the same wiring re-connected into the correct terminals.\r\rThe HRT4-ZW room thermostat uses the latest technology that interfaces perfectly with the timeswitch. Self monitoring TPI (Time Proportional Control) software in the \u2018stat makes a series of precise calculations once it has entered the control or proportional band. When set to 6 cycles per hour the software will calculate the amount of heat needed during each 10 minute period and switch the boiler on for a proportion of those 10 minutes to maintain the set temperature.\r\rThis stops the wide fluctuations in temperature that can occur with conventional thermostats. The integral feature of the TPI software then \u2018fine tunes\u2019 the calculations to constantly review its performance and carry out further fine adjustments if necessary.\r\rThe system will now be compliant with Part L1 of the 2010 Building Regulations for existing heating systems \u2013 a relatively quick and straightforward change over that can produce significant cost savings for the householder.",

Things do the basic stuff we tell them to \u2013 nothing more, nothing less.\rThat\u2019s a description of a house of the past.\r\rThe house of today has intelligence built in. Or at least it should.\r\rInspired by the humble thermostat, Aeotec\u2019s Z-Wave Door & Window Sensor sits as a part of our Intelligence range. Like a thermostat, we\u2019ve designed it to find things out, to understand things about your home, and to then use that information to make your home more comfortable, to make your life easier.\r\rThe Door & Window Sensor finds out something very simple \u2013 whether a door or a window, or in fact any object in your home, is open or closed. But there\u2019s power in simplicity. Power that allows you to inform the rest of your Z-Wave network about your selected doors and windows. Like a thermostat lets your heating and cooling systems know what they should do next, Aeotec\u2019s Z-Wave Door & Window Sensor does the same. Perhaps an open door means that your lights should turn on and welcome you home. Perhaps an open window means that an alarm should be trigged. Whatever it means to your home, with door and window sensors installed, your Z-Wave network will have both the power and the itelligence to do it.",

It is a hub that allows for cost efficient connection of many systems and devices to each other, to the network, to back-end systems and to the users with easy, ubiquitous interfaces. ThereGate is a development of the Nokia Home Control Center (HCC). It is a Linux based platform with open interfaces and a software engine (ThereCore\u2122) that enables easy creation of applications and the integration of different devices, technologies and protocols. The base services (ThereWare\u2122), once implemented for one device, are then equally available to any solution built on ThereGate \u2013 either by There Corporation or by any party developing applications that run on the gateway.\r\rDepending on the solution, connectivity may be realized in different ways. Some applications are mainly used locally, but most involve remote connections. The ThereGate concept is designed to work equally well with regular existing internet connections and the optional built in 3G modem, regardless if the user is a service provider\u2019s system or a person browsing with a cellular phone.\r \rIn addition to the power of limitless connectivity and local processing options ThereGate also has a full fledged Web server inside, like any powerful Linux server. This web server is connected to all the services and resources inside the gate allowing for development of local applications and displays.\r \rThe possibility for local applications and displays & user interfaces is important for a number of reasons, one of them being the interactivity and speed. To gather and display real-time information from a number of sources just doesn\u2019t make sense any other way than locally. The amount of data in this kind of applications makes use of back-end systems or web portals too impractical and expensive. The amount and granularity of real-time or near real-time measurement data also brings along the issues of privacy \u2013 because it can reveal very much information of the property and the inhabitants. So this kind of information is best safe at home, only in the fingers of the person(s) who own it. Relevant pieces of it can then be made available for external services.",

Things do the basic stuff we tell them to \u2013 nothing more, nothing less. \rThat\u2019s a description of a house of the past. \r\rThe house of today has intelligence built in. Or at least it should. \r\rInspired by the humble thermostat, Aeotec\u2019s Z-Wave Door & Window Sensor sits as a part of our Intelligence range. Like a thermostat, we\u2019ve designed it to find things out, to understand things about your home, and to then use that information to make your home more comfortable, to make your life easier. \r\rThe Door & Window Sensor finds out something very simple \u2013 whether a door or a window, or in fact any object in your home, is open or closed. But there\u2019s power in simplicity. Power that allows you to inform the rest of your Z-Wave network about your selected doors and windows. Like a thermostat lets your heating and cooling systems know what they should do next, Aeotec\u2019s Z-Wave Door & Window Sensor does the same. Perhaps an open door means that your lights should turn on and welcome you home. Perhaps an open window means that an alarm should be trigged. Whatever it means to your home, with door and window sensors installed, your Z-Wave network will have both the power and the itelligence to do it.",

But saving money by using less electricity is only possible if we understand when and how we use it. That\u2019s what Aeotec\u2019s Z-Wave Home Energy Meter provides you with \u2013 understanding. \r\rInstalled in an electricity box, the energy meter will monitor the total consumption of electricity used by an entire building. And its intelligent clamps will report that energy use back to your Z-Wave gateway or controller, in watts or kilowatt-hours, and in real time. So you can see how much electricity you really use and when you use it.",

The Flood Detector is designed so that the transceiver is mounted on the wall and the flood sensor is placed in a location where water presence, such as a result of leakage or flooding, is probable. Upon flood detection, the Detector will beep and flash and report its status to the node ID. Once water is released, it will report to the node ID as well. \r\rThe Flood Detector is powered by 3 x AA 1.5V alkaline battery. When battery level drops below unacceptable level, the Detector flashes red LED once every 30 seconds and reports low battery status to the node ID. When this occurs, the batteries should be replaced as soon as possible.",

When the detector is cooperated with security appliances, the detector is acting as a security device by detecting changes in infra-red radiation levels. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted to cause full alarm condition in order to frighten intruders away. Alternatively, when the detector is worked with Z-Wave Controller , the detector can be set to perform the role of home automation device by detecting both changes in infra-red radiation levels and percentage of lux levels.  Once night falls, the percentage of ambient illumination is lower than preset value. If a person moves within or across the devices field of vision, a trigger radio signal will be transmitted so as to turn connected lightings for better illumination.\r\"",

The Flood Detector is designed so that the transceiver is mounted on the wall and the flood sensor is placed in a location where water presence, such as a result of leakage or flooding, is probable. Upon flood detection, the Detector will beep and flash and report its status to the node ID. Once water is released, it will report to the node ID as well. \r\rThe Flood Detector is powered by 3 x AA 1.5V alkaline battery. When battery level drops below unacceptable level, the Detector flashes red LED once every 30 seconds and reports low battery status to the node ID. When this occurs, the batteries should be replaced as soon as possible.",

Remote On\/Off control of the connected load is possible with other manufacturer\u2019s wireless Controller. Each switch is designed to act as a repeater. Repeaters will re-transmit the RF signal to ensure that the signal is received by its\rintended destination by routing the signal around obstacles and radio dead spots. Because Home Control Metering Plug supports Security Command Class, it can be added with a Secured controller. Its functionality and supported command classes is identical when included as a secure and non-secure device. \rThis plug-in ON\/OFF switch is able to detect instance wattage   (3000W\/CE\/CN,1500W\/UL\/TW\/JP) and overload current (14.5A) of connected lights or appliances. When detecting overload state, the Switch will be disabled and its On\/Off button will be lockout of which LED will flash quickly.   However, unplug and re-connect the switch will reset its overload condition to normal status.",
